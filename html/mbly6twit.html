	The plot shows the last six hours of data from an MVO seismic station located at Lee's Yard, Montserrat.

	<LI>Each horizontal trace shows 10 minutes of ground movement data, sampled 200 times every second.</LI>
	<LI>The latest data is on the bottom line.</LI>
	<LI>Large signals are cropped and plotted in red</LI>
	<LI>Local time is shown on the left margin of the plot. </LI>
	<LI>The time of a signal is obtained by adding the time along the bottom scale to the time for that line given in the left margin.</LI>
	<LI>Seismologists like to work in Universal Time (UTC), which is shown on the right margin of the plot.</LI>
	<LI>The twitter feed on the right has comments from MVO about interesting signals, with their times of occurrence. You won't get comments for every single blip and wiggle.</LI>
	<LI>This page updates automatically every minute.</LI>

    The plot shown here mimics the plot drawn when you wrap a piece of paper around a rotating drum and slowly move the pen along its length.  We still call it a "helicorder" or "drum" plot.
